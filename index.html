    <h1>Favourite Courses</h1>
    <dl>
       <dt>ITM200:Fundementals of Programming</dt> <br>
       <dd>This course taught the basics of Python coding. Once the student learned the basic tools for coding <br> it challanged them with interesting and thought provoking projects. This course was very useful <br> because it pushed students to think outside the box and with every lecture came new challanges and <br> learning experiences.</dd> <br>
       <dt>ACC406:Intro Management Accounting</dt> <br>
       <dd>ACC406 taught accounting for managerial purposes. It delved into the accounting field and expanded <br> the student's knwoledge on how accounting items are allocated within a business for performance <br> optimization. This course was very memorable because the accounting processes were very logical and <br> the professor was very elaborative when explaining the details of making investment decisions in an <br> organization.</dd>

    <h1>Educational Awards and Extra-curricular Activities</h1>
    <p>In highschool I used to play for my school's volleyball team in grade 9 and 10. The team and I have received multiple awards <br> for placing first and thrid place in the first and second year respectively. In my first year at TMU, I attended a course called <br> global management. Part of the course was working as a group in a virtual industry management website called GLO-BUS. <br> The objective was to create the most profitable "company" in the class. The group and I received a certificate award for <br> placing top 10 in the country.  </p>
